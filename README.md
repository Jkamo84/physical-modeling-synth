# physical-modeling-synth
This project is a virtual guitar instrument made by implementing physical modeling.
This project works with some dependencies in order to generate audio files and also to improve some functionalidies due to loading times.

To run it, just execute mass_spring_optimized, it should get the configuration from model_settings.py, and the song sequence from data.py

Theversion used for this proyect was Python 3.8.5

To run this program, you can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies noted on requirements.txt

```python
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The program as is, already has some implementations ready to run to test the functionalities, but some configurations can be made to customize what the user wants.
