# physical-modeling-synth
This project is a virtual guitar instrument made by implementing physical modeling.
This project works with some dependencies in order to generate audio files and also to improve some functionalidies due to loading times.

To run it, just execute mass_spring_optimized, it should get the configuration from model_settings.py, and the song sequence from data.py
